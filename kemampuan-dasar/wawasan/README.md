## **Information technology**
Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data or information. IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies.
### **History of computer technology**
* 1940s > begin
* 1941 > world first programmable computer “electromechanical Zuse Z3”
* 1959 > IC & MOSFET
* 1971 > microprocessor by intel

IC, MOSFET and microprocessor are the origin of PC and information and communications technology (ICT)

### **Electronic data processing**
Composed by Data Storage, Database, Data retrieval, Data Transmission, Data Manipulation
## **Difference between Computer Science and Informatics**
**Computer science** is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers.
**Informatics** is a branch of information engineering. It involves the practice of information processing and the engineering of information systems, and as an academic field it is an applied form of information science
## **Software development**
Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components
### **Methodologies**
Most methodologies share some combination of the following stages of software development:
*	Analyzing the problem
*	Market research
*	Gathering requirements for the proposed software
*	Devising a plan or design for the software
*	Implementation (coding) of the software
*	Testing the software
*	Deployment
*	Maintenance and bug fixing
### **Software development activities**
* Identification of need
* Planning Process
* Designing
* Implementation, Testing, Documenting
* Deployment and maintenance
## **Agile software development**

In software development, agile practices involve discovering requirements and developing solutions through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages flexible responses to change.
